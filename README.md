Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility.
This principle promotes the idea that a class should encapsulate a single functionality, and if there is more than one reason for it to change, the class should be divided into multiple classes, each with a single responsibility.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a system without altering its existing code. This is typically achieved through the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

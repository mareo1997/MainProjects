Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility.
This principle promotes the idea that a class should encapsulate a single functionality, and if there is more than one reason for it to change, the class should be divided into multiple classes, each with a single responsibility.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a system without altering its existing code. This is typically achieved through the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
In other words, objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that inheritance is used correctly and that the derived classes extend the behavior of the base class without changing it.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.
This principle suggests that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. Instead of having a large, monolithic interface, it's better to have smaller, more specific interfaces tailored to the needs of the implementing classes.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
This principle encourages the use of dependency injection and inversion of control to achieve a decoupled and flexible design. High-level modules (e.g., business logic) should not depend on low-level modules (e.g., data access), but both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).

Dependency injection provides several benefits:

Decoupling: By injecting dependencies, classes become less dependent on the specific implementation details of their dependencies. This leads to more modular and loosely coupled code.

Testability: Injecting dependencies makes it easier to replace real dependencies with mock objects or test doubles during unit testing, allowing for more effective and isolated testing.

Flexibility: With dependency injection, it becomes easier to change or extend the behavior of a class by providing different implementations of its dependencies.

Reusability: Classes become more reusable since they are not tied to the concrete implementations of their dependencies. This makes it easier to use the same class in different contexts.

Consistency and Interoperability: By providing a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, the framework ensures consistency and interoperability among various APIs.

Increased Productivity: Developers can leverage a wide range of pre-built classes and interfaces, saving time and effort in implementing common data structures.

Performance: The framework is designed to be efficient, and its implementations are optimized for various use cases.

Flexibility: With a variety of collection types available, developers can choose the one that best suits the requirements of their specific use case.

Scalability: The framework supports scalable data structures, allowing developers to handle large amounts of data efficiently.

ArrayList:

Provides fast random access (constant time) because elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
LinkedList:

Access time for arbitrary elements is slower (linear time) because it involves traversing the list.
ArrayList:

Uses a dynamic array to store elements.
Accessing elements by index is fast.
Insertions and deletions at arbitrary positions are relatively slower as it may require shifting elements.
LinkedList:

Uses a doubly-linked list to store elements.
Insertions and deletions at arbitrary positions are faster because it involves adjusting pointers, not shifting elements.
Accessing elements by index requires traversing the list from the beginning or end, making it slower than ArrayList.

Both HashMap and HashSet are part of the Java Collections Framework and are used to store and manage collections of elements. They are both implementations of the Map and Set interfaces, respectively, and they share some similarities but also have key differences.

both HashMap and HashSet share some similarities in terms of not guaranteeing order and allowing null elements, their main differences lie in their intended use cases (key-value mappings vs. unique element storage) and the specific interfaces they implement.
HashMap is designed for key-value mappings.
HashSet is designed for storing unique elements.
Interfaces Implemented:

HashMap implements the Map interface.
HashSet implements the Set interface.
Usage:

Use HashMap when you need to store key-value pairs.
Use HashSet when you need to store a collection of unique elements.
Nulls:

HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.
HashSet allows a single null element.
Duplication:

HashMap allows duplicate values but not duplicate keys.
HashSet does not allow duplicate elements.
Iteration:

Iterating through a HashMap involves working with key-value pairs.
Iterating through a HashSet involves working with individual elements.

Multithreading in Java refers to the concurrent execution of two or more threads within a single program. A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can be scheduled by the operating system. Multithreading allows for the execution of multiple threads concurrently, which can lead to improved performance and responsiveness in certain applications.

In Java, multithreading can be achieved in two main ways:

1. Extending the Thread Class:
You can create a thread by extending the Thread class and overriding its run method.
2. Implementing the Runnable Interface:
Another way to create a thread is by implementing the Runnable interface. This approach is often preferred as it allows better separation of concerns between the thread's behavior and the class's other responsibilities:

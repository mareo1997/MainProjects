Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility.
This principle promotes the idea that a class should encapsulate a single functionality, and if there is more than one reason for it to change, the class should be divided into multiple classes, each with a single responsibility.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a system without altering its existing code. This is typically achieved through the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
In other words, objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that inheritance is used correctly and that the derived classes extend the behavior of the base class without changing it.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.
This principle suggests that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. Instead of having a large, monolithic interface, it's better to have smaller, more specific interfaces tailored to the needs of the implementing classes.
